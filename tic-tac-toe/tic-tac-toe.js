/*
Imagine you are playing a game of tic-tac-toe and you are trying to see if the current
board is solved.
If you never played the game, here is a good simulator: http://playtictactoe.org/
Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty,
1 if it is an X, or 2 if it is an O, like so:
[[0,0,1],
 [0,1,2],
 [2,1,0]]
We want our function to return -1 if the board is not solved yet, 1 if X won, 2 if O won,
or 0 if it's a draw.
You may assume that the board passed in is valid.
Example:
var board = [[0,0,1],
             [0,1,2],
             [2,1,0]];
ticTacToe(board);//should return -1
var solvedBoard = [[0,1,1],
                   [0,1,2],
                   [2,1,2]];
ticTacToe(solvedBoard);//should return 1
*/

function ticTacToe(board){
	var X = 1 , O=2 ;
	if(board === []){
		return 0; 
	}
	for (var i=0 ; i<3; i++) {
		for (var j=0 ; j<3; j++){
			if (i=j){
				if (board[i][j] === 1  || board[i][j] === 2 ){
					return 1 ; 
				}	
			}else {
				if ( board[i][j] === 1 ||  board[i][j] === 2 ){
					return 1 ; 
				}	
			}else {
				for (var j=0 ; j<3; j++) {
					for (var i=0 ; i<3; i++){
						if (i=j){
							if ( board[i][j] === 1 ||  board[i][j] === 2 ){
								return 1 ; 
							}	
						}else if (board[i][j] === 1)|| board[i][j] === 2 ){
							return 1 ; 
						}	
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return -1 ; 
};
